# Bid_Library
GroupEngineeringProject

1. What is the project about?
The task of our group was to create a bid library system for Atos. Atos produces documents outlining its proposed contents for existing customers. Our system allows Atos to create, edit and store these contents on an online application. This is done through pre-approved text in the form of content that is written and uploaded via the application. Our system also allows users to search for any content they want, our application would group together these contents for a specific solution allowing easy editing and viewing of a specific solution document.
